# matchstick_game
A 2 player game I was playing as a kid.
The goal is NOT to be the last person crossing out (or in this APP burning) a match.
The players have to cross out at least one match at each turn. Multiple matches can be crossed out if on the same row and contiguous (i.e. no crossed out match lies in between them).

The game can be played against the PC which will use a minimax alpha-beta pruned optimal strategy to play the game.
According to the inital matches layout, either the first or the second player will have a winning strategy.
